I found their website but there's literally no information on it other than the general exams and products they offer. I went there yesterday for an eye exam and a new pair of glasses. I paid in cash so I can't speak on insurance, but the doctor himself was fantastic. Extremely kind, knowledgeable and funny. Knew exactly what he was doing. The desk people were also great for helping me pick a frame and I'm super happy with the one I picked. They had my glasses ready in an hour for me. 1 0.8101444935747758\n",
      "Planning on getting a minor from the college of business. Do you guys recommend a specific one? I was thinking between Business or Economics. Not sure what to do.

      "Bright Future and Pegasus Scholarship Question For you to continue to receive these scholarships is it your semester or overall GPA that has to stay above a 3.0? Thanks You need to have a 3.0 GPA in the classes you enrolled in for both Fall and Spring. So if you take 12 credit hours for Fall and for Spring, and you fail one of those classes, you do not meet the eligibility requirements to be a Full Time student and continue receiving the scholarship. So as long as your Overall GPA stays above 3.0, and you pass enough classes to be considered full-time, you should be good. 1 0.7509184851098148\n",
