How bad are his finals and what can I do to make sure I do well on it?"	I got an A on the final. However prior to that I studied basically everything and got high B's or A's on the other exams. For the final I was a little burnout so I mostly just studied the newest material and reviewed old stuff. I also had a flashcard program that had notes/slides of everything in the class up to that point so review was a lot easier. You really need to have decent understanding of the concepts and terminology so that you can answer most right and/or guess most right.	1

Thanks	"You need to have a 3.0 GPA in the classes you enrolled in for both Fall and Spring. So if you take 12 credit hours for Fall and for Spring, and you fail one of those classes, you do not meet the eligibility requirements to be a Full Time student and continue receiving the scholarship. So as long as your Overall GPA stays above 3.0, and you pass enough classes to be considered full-time, you should be good."	1
